- Several tests are performed for the verification of the transport model using logical meshes
- All tests correspond to surface transport (no subgrid) on Y-mesh
- ATS version : v0.88 (remmember it avoid flow simulation!)

Q1 = Discharge [m^3/sec] in the main stream
Q2 = Discharge [m^3/sec] in the main_left child stream
Q3 = Discharge [m^3/sec] in the main_right child stream

test1_Y: Q1 = Q2 + Q3, Q2 = Q3
test2_Y: Q1 = Q2 + Q3, Q2 > Q3
test3_Y: Q1 > Q2 + Q3, Q2 > Q3

#-------------------------------------------------------------------

test4_Y: prescribed face fluxes and read Y-mesh from .xml file

test5_Y: Read face fluxes from HDF5 file and Y-mesh from .xml file

Note:
- in HDF5 files, number of face fluxes are "number of cells + number of junctions"
For example, Y-mesh with 2 cells each segment. Total #faces = 8
| | |
     x| | | 
| | | 
the flux at the x face is not given in the .h5 file, its computed from the fluxes of child streams (upstreams). This ensures continuity of fluxes.
